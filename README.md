# PORTFOLIO 2 SANDBOX NETWORK

# INTRODUCTION
This report details the configuration and operation of a sandboxed network that I built with VitualBox. Three virtual machines (VMs) connected over two subnets make up the network. In this configuration, the three VMs are:

1.UBUNTU Desktop
2.Gateway-Router
3.Server(Word press)
